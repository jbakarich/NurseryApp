Rather than doing anything with a prefs file, everything is run through the local database. The only thing that should be stored in the prefs is an id number that relates to a user id in the database.

| | |     DB_TableClasses:
| | |     -Is just a placeholder for db classes. The idea is that since Java is not a big fan of multi object type dictionaries or hashtables, we use our own classes as intermediaries between the database and the user. Rather than making multiple queries for different types of data, we make one query to these classes and then they self populate with the information needed from the database.
| | |     TODO: implement all of the getter setter functions; these will be the links between the rest of the application and the database.
| | |     
| | |     AA_DatabaseOperations was upgraded to DB_Manager, AA_DatabaseImport was upgraded to DB_Models and DB_DB_Accessor.
| | |     
| | |     AA_MainActivity, LoginActivity, and LoginFragment were updated with new database names
